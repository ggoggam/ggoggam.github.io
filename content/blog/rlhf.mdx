It has been almost 2 years (!) since ChatGPT was released. 
I had been following the evolution of natural language processing research before ChatGPT came out.
In this post, I would like to give a brief overview of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), 
the main approach taken to create ChatGPT and its rivaling cousins such as Claude and Gemini. 
My recent research focuses on a novel method for RLHF in an offline setting, so it is rather timely to talk about this.
