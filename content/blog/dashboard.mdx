As I was wrapping up my academic work, I took on a quick side project to build a dashboard for monitoring server statuses in my lab. 
There used to be a similar tool created by a former lab member, but it had become outdated and was no longer maintained.
My primary focus for this new dashboard was to make it: 1. simple 2. maintainable  3. modestly secure and 4. look nice. 

Here is the final product (with some details redacted):

## Setup

### Framework Choice
When choosing frameworks, I prioritized maintainability. 
Since most lab members were already familiar with Python but had no experience with popular frontend frameworks like React, I implemented the web server using FastAPI, a widely-used ASGI framework in Python.

For the user interface, I relied on vanilla HTML/CSS, Jinja templates, and DaisyUI[^1], a lightweight component library that enhances Tailwind CSS.

For interactivity, I opted for HTMX. If you’re unfamiliar with HTMX, check out my previous [post](/blog/htmx). 
Since I avoided JavaScript runtimes, I included minified JS libraries for HTMX, Tailwind, and DaisyUI, along with their stylesheets, in the static folder.

Thankfully, FastAPI makes serving static files incredibly simple:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles

app = FastAPI()
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
```

## Templates
The HTML templates were powered by **Jinja2 Fragments**[^2], which allowed partial rendering of templates by targeting specific block names. This setup, combined with HTMX, made templates concise and easy to maintain.
This makes for a concise template files for easier maintenance when coupled with HTMX.

For example, here’s a snippet from index.html with a content block:
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!-- some base template to inherit from -->
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
    <h1 class="text-2xl">On-Premise Server Status</h1>
    {% set running = running | default([]) %}
    {% if running | length > 0 %}
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
        {% block on_premise_instances %}
        {% for instance in running %}
            {% with is_last = loop.last, name = instance.name %}
                {% include 'on_premise/instance.html' %}
            {% endwith %}
        {% endfor %}
        {% endblock %}
    </div>
    {% endif %}
    <div id="page-indicator" class="htmx-indicator loading loading-bars loading-lg self-center"/>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

Depending on the route and request type, I could choose to return either the entire template or just parts of it. For instance:
- /on-premise: Returns the content block for HTMX requests or the full page otherwise.
- /on-premise/instances: Returns a partial block for lazy loading upon refresh.

Here’s how these routes are implemented:
```python showLineNumbers
# dependencies
# check_session: checks for valid session cookie. if session is invalid or has expired, move to login page
# is_htmx_request: check for `hx-request` header in the request
@app.get(
    "/on-premise",
    response_class=HTMLResponse,
    dependencies=[Depends(check_session), Depends(is_htmx_request)],
)
async def on_premise_page(request: Request):
    running_instances = await onpremise_service.get_server_infos(after=0, size=1)
    # load all on-premise servers in background
    return templates.TemplateResponse(
        "index.html",
        context={
            "running": running_instances,
            "request": request,
        },
        block_name="content" if request.is_htmx_request else None,
    )

...

@app.get(
    "/on-premise/instances",
    response_class=HTMLResponse,
    dependencies=[Depends(check_session)],
)
async def get_on_premise_instances(
    request: Request, after: Optional[str], size: int = 1
):
    running_instances = await onpremise_service.get_server_infos(
        after=after, size=size
    )
    return templates.TemplateResponse(
        "index.html",
        context={
            "running": running_instances,
            "request": request,
        },
        block_name="on_premise_instances",
    )
```

## Minor optimizations

To gather server information remotely, I used [`paramiko`](https://www.paramiko.org/), a Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol. 
This approach is safer than executing commands with subprocess or similar tools.

Since commands like `nvidia-smi` (for GPU info) can be slow, I implemented lazy loading and pagination using HTMX. The `hx-trigger="revealed"` attribute in HTMX ensures that paginated endpoints are called only when the last loaded element is visible.

Here’s an example of lazy loading:
```html
{% if is_last %}
<div class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200" hx-get="/on-premise/instances?after={{ name }}&size=5" hx-trigger="revealed" hx-swap="afterend" hx-indicator="#page-indicator">
    <input type="checkbox" name="{{ name }}"/>
    <div class="collapse-title flex flex-row items-center gap-x-4">
        {% if instance.usage == 0 %}
            {% set status = 'success' %}
        {% elif instance.usage < 50 %}
            {% set status = 'warning' %}
        {% else %}
            {% set status = 'error' %}
        {% endif %}
        <div class="badge badge-{{ status }} badge-xs"></div>
        <div class="text-2xl font-medium">
            {{ instance.name }}
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
        <div class="flex justify-end">
            <button class="btn btn-neutral btn-md" hx-get="/on-premise/instance/{{ name }}" hx-swap="innerHTML" hx-target="#{{ name }}-content" hx-indicator="#{{ name }}-indicator">
                <span id="{{ name }}-indicator" class="htmx-indicator loading loading-dots loading-sm"></span>
                Refresh
            </button>
        </div>

        <div id="{{ name }}-content" class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
            {% include 'on_premise/instance_content.html' %}
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% else %}
<div class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
    <input type="checkbox" name="{{ name }}"/>
    <div class="collapse-title flex flex-row items-center gap-x-4">
        {% if instance.usage == 0 %}
            {% set status = 'success' %}
        {% elif instance.usage < 50 %}
            {% set status = 'warning' %}
        {% else %}
            {% set status = 'error' %}
        {% endif %}
        <div class="badge badge-{{ status }} badge-xs"></div>
        <div class="text-2xl font-medium">
            {{ instance.name }}
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
        <div class="flex justify-end">
            <button class="btn btn-neutral btn-md" hx-get="/on-premise/instance/{{ name }}" hx-swap="innerHTML" hx-target="#{{ name }}-content" hx-indicator="#{{ name }}-indicator">
                <span id="{{ name }}-indicator" class="htmx-indicator loading loading-dots loading-sm"></span>
                Refresh
            </button>
        </div>

        <div id="{{ name }}-content" class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
            {% include 'on_premise/instance_content.html' %}
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

To speed things up further, I implemented a time-to-live cache for service methods (all written as async functions). 
For details, refer to [my post](/blog/cache-async-py) on caching async functions.

Additionally, I created a simple session management service to ensure that only authorized users could access the dashboard.

## Dockerize & Deploy
To ensure consistency and security, I containerized the application using Docker. I chose the lightweight slim-buster image as the base for Python:
```docker
FROM python:3.10.8-slim-buster

RUN apt-get update -y

WORKDIR /code
COPY requirements.txt /code
RUN pip install --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

COPY src /code

# launch entry script
ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "main.py" ]
```

I also created a GitHub workflow to automate the release process:
```yaml
name: Build Docker Image and Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*.*.*'

jobs:
  build-and-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      # bunch of secret variables

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Set dot env
        run: |
          echo "RANDOM_API_KEY=${RANDOM_API_KEY}" >> .env
          mv .env src

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build --platform linux/amd64 --tag dashboard:latest .

      - name: Save Docker image to file
        run: |
          docker save -o release.tar.gz dashboard:latest

      - name: Get release
        id: get_release
        uses: bruceadams/get-release@v1.3.2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}

      - name: Upload Docker image to Release
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.get_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./release.tar.gz
          asset_name: release.tar.gz
          asset_content_type: application/gzip
```

This project took less than a day to implement, thanks to the simplicity of FastAPI and HTMX. After some minor tweaks for mobile responsiveness, the dashboard was well-received by my lab members.

Hopefully, it will remain a valuable tool for the team.
