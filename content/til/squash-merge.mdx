We can 'squash' multiple commits in Git into a single commit to make things cleaner. It is easy to do when you are only rebasing the commits in a single branch without merge commits. However, things can get a bit tricky when you have merge commits in the history.

You can do this easily by the following steps:

```bash
git checkout -b temp {main-branch}
git merge --squash {feature-branch}
git commit 
git checkout {feature-branch}
git reset --hard temp
git branch -D temp
git push -u origin {feature-branch} --force
```

This will squash all the commits in the `feature-branch` into a single commit and push it to the remote repository.
