# Fullstack Development
Noadays it is common to use NextJS for fullstack and server side rendering applications. 
While it is powerful and easy to use out of the box, it does not provide common heavyweight server side features such as task queues, scheduled tasks, and background processing.

## Backend + React
Hence it is common to use some backend framework to delegate such tasks. For golang, it is common to see fiber or gin as the backend framework.
For Java and Kotlin, Spring Boot has always been a popular choice, although it is not apples to apples comparison with golang.

We can use Spring Boot to handle the backend and (vanilla) React to handle the frontend. 
The problem is that we do not want to have separate servers for the frontend and backend.
One way to do this is by building the frontend then serving it as static files in the backend.

# Spring Boot
Generate a Spring Boot project by visiting [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
Then add the following dependecy:

```kotlin
runtimeOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools")
```

Also add the following line in the `*Application.kt` file, which serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application:

```kotlin
@SpringBootApplication
class Application : WebMvcConfigurer {
    override fun addViewControllers(registry: ViewControllerRegistry) {
        registry.addViewController("/").setViewName("index.html")
    }
}
```


# Vite
Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster development experience for modern web projects.
Build the frontend by watching the files for change, then output the files the `src/main/resources/static` directory, 
which is the default directory for serving static files in Spring Boot.

First, add the following line in the `vite.config.ts` file:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outDir: '../src/main/resources/static',
  },
})
```

Then run the following commands:
```shell
$ pnpm init vite@latest
$ ... # follow the instructions

$ cd client
$ pnpm install
$ vite build --watch --emptyOutDir
```

# Watching for Changes for Static files
Spring Boot by default does not watch for changes in the static files.
We have added the devtools dependency above, and it can both 1. restart and 2. reload (refresh) the server when the file changes. 

To enable the server to watch for changes in the static files, add the following line in the `application.yaml` file:
```yaml
spring:
  devtools:
    restart:
      enabled: true
      additional-paths: file:src/main/resources/static

  web:
    resources:
      static-locations: file:src/main/resources/static
```
This ensures that the server will rebuild and restart when the static files change.
