I was recently introduced to a novel concept by a co-worker of mine in the lab, and truly excited about what it bring to the current research scene in artificial intelligence.
The novel framework is called GFlowNets (short for **G**enerative **Flow** **Net**works)



```math
L(s) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i \prod_{j \geq 0} t_j
```
