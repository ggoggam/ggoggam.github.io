I was recently introduced to the TPU Resarch Cloud (TRC) program by a colleague.
TRC is an initiative by Google to provide computing resources to independent or academic researchers around the world.
It is gaining popularity among researchers as it is entirely **FREE**, only with minimal overhead cost for networking and storage. 
Moreover, it is fast, especially if you are using JAX as your choice of deep learning framework.
