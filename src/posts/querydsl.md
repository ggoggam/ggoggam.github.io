When creating a decently sized web service, a natural choice would be using a relational database along with some querying interface.
In this post, I would like to direct my attention to the SQL interface such as ORM or pure query where there has been more than a decade long feud on which is the best. 

## Pure SQL


```sql

```

```sql
SELECT id, 
```
